* Long-term memory
* Ask user their persona (experienced data scientist, business user, etc.)
* What mode are you in? Exploring an unknown dataset? Testing a hypothesis? Communicating a point visually?
* Have a more generic way for the assistant to know what data is available, and how to load it from a fresh session. (Could be as dumb as an llms.txt in the current directory?)
